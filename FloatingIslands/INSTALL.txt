FloatingIslands ver. 1.0 installation instrutctions

1.  Download the latest version of CraftBukkit (if nor already done):
   	- go for http://www.bukkit.org -> follow the the link to the recommended build
   	  on the right
   	- download craftbukkit.jar and put it into a empty folder (this will be your
   	  "installation folder")
   	
2.	Ajust the config: if your bukkit server is already installed and you've made
	changes to the default config, you will have to adjust the configuration files
	manually:
	- open "bukkit.yml" in your favorite text editor and append the following content:
	  
	  worlds:<enter>
	  <exactly two spaces>floatingIslands:<enter>
	  <exactly four spaces>defaultGenerator:<enter>
	  
	  Be sure to type it character by character as above or it will not work!
	  You could also copy these three lines form the "bukkit.yml"-file provided
	  with this plugin.
	- open "server.properties" with yout default text editor and change the line
	
	  level-name: <world-name>
	  
	  to the following:
	  
	  level-name: floatingsIslands
	  
	  Save the new settings.
	
	If you just installed CraftBukkit or deleted the configuration files, you may
	simply copy the provided "bukki.yml" and "server.properties" into the installation
	folder of your BukkitServer. These are the default configuration files with the
	needed changes already made.
	The adjustment of the configuration files will force the server to generate a new
	world with the name "floatingIslands" with the new chunk generator provided by this
	plugin.
