FloatingIslands Minecraft Bukkit Server Plugin

This is a plugin that generates a fourth world alongside the Overworld,
the Nether and the End. This world consists solely of tiny islands of dirt
or stone with trees, tall grass, reeds, pumkins and much more...
This plugin is inspired by the SkyblockSurvival, you start with a bucket
of lava, a ice block, a melon seed and one bone to build a cobble generator
first. This allows you to make it over to other islands and gain their
ressources. Use water scaffolding to get down to the valuable stone islands
with redstone and diamond ores.

Installation:
	Simply put FloatingIslands.jar in Bukkits plugin folder and restart
	your server.

Configuration:
	level0-min-gen-height and level0-max-gen-height control the generation
	height of the bottom stone islands. level0-gen-probability reflects
	the probability of generating a island in a chunk.
	The same parameters exist for level1, for the main dirt islands.
	generateStructures is unimplemented up to now and unused therefore.
	startItems are the items a player receives upon first join in the
	FloatingIslands realm.

Permissions:
	FloatingIslands.join - unimplemented up to now.
